## Design Approach

The way I understood the problem was to design, provision, and deploy a data platform to extract,
transform, and load the SpaceX API dataset, enabling business-oriented queries.

I started with Part 1, creating a high-level architectural diagram. For this, I selected a
technology stack that I believed would effectively address the problem.

Once I had a clear idea of the overall design, I decided to jump into Part 3 next. I felt that
getting hands-on with the data, understanding how it is structured, how to model it properly,
and how to build a solid ETL pipeline would give me a stronger foundation to approach Part 2 with more confidence.

I must admit that I was a bit confused during the data modeling phas. I was not sure if the focus
was the Launches data set or if the rest of entities needed to be considered. Based on the suggested
business questions, I assumed Launches might be sufficient. However, I also wanted to prepare for
the possibility of addressing additional questions later in the interview process. Thatâ€™s why I
chose to extend the model beyond Launches and include other relevant entities.
